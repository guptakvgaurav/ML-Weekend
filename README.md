# ML-Weekend

**How we want this group to get going**

* Given a dataset we want to prepare a set of problem statement. And at the weekend, we will split ourselves into groups/individual and make things happens.
* We will keep the things rolling at our own pace (I hope that won't add much delay).
* This is not a competition nor a course which has an end date.
* We are anticipating some **volunatary participation from mentors** who can guide groups/individuals.

**Where to lookup for dataset for upcoming week**

* Every week's branch will be created. Ex - Branch for weekend starting on Jun 2, 2018 will be named as Jun_2_2018.
You can find data set on the week's branch itself.
* Week's branch will be merged at the end of week (ex branch Jun_2_2018 will be merged into master on Jun 8, 2018).
